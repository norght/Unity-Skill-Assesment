## Task 1: Gameplay

When the player presses the C key, a cube should spawn at a point A and move to a point B. Upon arrival at Point B, the cube should pause for 3 seconds before
moving to a point C. Upon arrival at point C, the cube should move back to point B, pause, then move back to point A. This sequence should repeat indefinitely. At
any time, the player should be able to pause and resume the sequence by pressing the P key.


## Task 2: UI

Create a responsive UI for Task 1. There should be a button to spawn a cube, a counter showing the number of spawned cubes, and a button to pause the game.
When the game is paused, a prompt should be displayed indicating the game is paused.

## Task 3: Testing

Write a unit test validating the correct functioning of the pause function from Task 1.
